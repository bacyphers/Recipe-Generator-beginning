The other night at midnight while watching Jay Leno (he's so funny) I got a craving for food.  I hit the kitchen running and there they sat:  two avocados I picked up at Walmart on sale.  Now, I'm from the country and we only eat guacamole at the Mexican restaurant if at all.  Most think it looks gross because it's green.  I love it.  So, they called to me....I heard their cries and I got out my knife and whacked those little suckers right down the middle, scooped that deeelishush stuff out in a bowl and realized, I didn't have any tomatoes.  OH NO!  So..here's what I came up with...Not too bad, even if I do say so myself.  Also discovered I didn't have any chips...This was my solution.
